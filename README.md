# GreenJinn Coding Challenge

## User Story

Using React:
- Display a chessboard with a default FEN of: 8/2p5/8/8/8/8/8/8 w KQkq - 0 1
- Include a button that adds a white pawn to a random legal position on the board.
- Allow that pawn to make legal moves across the board.
- Do not use any 3rd-party chess libraries.
- Return your code in an online executable sandbox, such as https://codesandbox.io/
- Please complete this within the next 7 days (do let me know if personal circumstances don't permit).. Also make sure you give an indication of how much time you spent on the solution.
